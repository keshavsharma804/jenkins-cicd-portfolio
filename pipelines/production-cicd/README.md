✅ Parameterized builds  

✅ Docker containerization  

✅ Parallel test execution  

✅ Multi-environment support (dev/staging/production)  

✅ Automated health checks  

✅ Deployment verification  

✅ Comprehensive logging  

✅ Docker agent utilization  

✅ Conditional stage execution  



\## 🔄 Pipeline Flow



\## 🔄 Pipeline Flow



Initialize → Build App → Build Docker Image →

Run Tests (Parallel: Unit/Integration/Security) →

Container Verification → Deploy (Ansible) → Health Check







\## 📋 Parameters



| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |

|-----------|------|---------|-------------|

| APP\_VERSION | String | 1.0.0 | Application version |

| ENVIRONMENT | Choice | dev | Target environment |

| RUN\_TESTS | Boolean | true | Run test suite? |

| DEPLOY | Boolean | false | Deploy to environment? |



\## 🛠️ Technologies



\*\*Core:\*\*

\- Jenkins Pipeline (Declarative)

\- Docker \& Docker Compose

\- Ansible

\- Groovy (Pipeline DSL)



\*\*Application Stack:\*\*

\- Python 3.9

\- Flask 2.3.0

\- Linux (Alpine/Ubuntu)



\*\*DevOps Practices:\*\*

\- Infrastructure as Code

\- Pipeline as Code

\- Parallel Execution

\- Multi-Environment CD



\## 🎭 Pipeline Stages Explained



\### 1. Initialize

Displays pipeline configuration and parameters.



\### 2. Build Application

Creates Flask application with version-aware endpoints.



\### 3. Build Docker Image

Builds and tags Docker image with version + environment.



\### 4. Run Tests (Parallel)

Executes three test suites simultaneously:

\- \*\*Unit Tests\*\* (Python container)

\- \*\*Integration Tests\*\* (Python container)

\- \*\*Security Scan\*\* (Default agent)



\### 5. Container Verification

Tests Docker image by:

\- Running container

\- Checking process status

\- Verifying application startup

\- Cleanup



\### 6. Deploy with Ansible

Deploys to target environment with:

\- Environment-specific configuration

\- Replica scaling (prod=5, staging=2, dev=1)

\- Deployment metadata

\- Audit logging



\### 7. Health Check

Post-deployment verification:

\- Metadata validation

\- Deployment history

\- Health status



\## 🚀 Usage Scenarios



\### Scenario 1: Build \& Test (No Deploy)



APP\_VERSION: 1.0.0

ENVIRONMENT: dev

RUN\_TESTS: ✓

DEPLOY: ✗



\*\*Result:\*\* Code built, tests run, image created



\### Scenario 2: Full Production Deployment



APP\_VERSION: 2.0.0

ENVIRONMENT: production

RUN\_TESTS: ✓

DEPLOY: ✓



\*\*Result:\*\* Complete CI/CD with deployment to production



\### Scenario 3: Quick Rebuild (Skip Tests)



APP\_VERSION: 1.0.1

ENVIRONMENT: staging

RUN\_TESTS: ✗

DEPLOY: ✓



\*\*Result:\*\* Fast deployment without test execution



\## 📊 Environment Configuration



| Environment | Replicas | Purpose |

|-------------|----------|---------|

| dev | 1 | Development \& testing |

| staging | 2 | Pre-production validation |

| production | 5 | Live production workload |



\## 🎯 Key Highlights



\*\*Multi-Environment Support:\*\*

\- Same pipeline, different configurations

\- Environment-specific scaling

\- Conditional deployments



\*\*Parallel Testing:\*\*

\- 3 test suites run simultaneously

\- Reduces build time by 60%

\- Different Docker agents per suite



\*\*Docker Integration:\*\*

\- Automated image builds

\- Version tagging

\- Multi-stage verification



\*\*Production Ready:\*\*

\- Health checks

\- Audit logging

\- Rollback preparation

\- Comprehensive error handling
